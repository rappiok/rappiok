### :woman_technologist:
I’m Ara, an IT operations and systems admin based in Ghana.

I work with systems, data, and infrastructure. And now, I’m building my path into industrial cybersecurity.

Curiosity led me into OT/ICS security, and it has ignited a real passion.

I’m currently developing hands-on skills in OT network monitoring, security automation, and system hardening. My favorite tools right now are VS Code, Wireshark, Python, and my notebook full of network diagrams and ideas.

You’ll soon see pinned projects from my research and transition into OT/ICS security, focusing on small, practical, and real-world industrial environments.

I’m also preparing for graduate studies in industrial cybersecurity, with interests in machine learning for OT monitoring, formal verification of safety-critical systems, and resilient architecture design for critical infrastructure.

I’m open to opportunities in IT operations roles, internships, and graduate research positions in industrial cybersecurity.

### Fun Facts:
* I love coffee or tea
* I’m a skincare enthusiast
* **Hobbies**:  dancing and learning new skills
